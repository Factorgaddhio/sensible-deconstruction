Sensible Deconstruction

A Factorio Mod that deconstructs buildings in a sensible way.

First deconstruct all buildings except Roboports and Electric poles.
Second deconstruct Roboports and Electric poles beginning from the edges.

This allows all selected buildings to be deconstructed by construction bots.

Use Shift-Ctrl-D to enable the newly introduced sensible deconstruction planner.

ALPHA-version - Additional testing and feedback appreciated.

Missing features:
- Solve performance issues with lots of Roboports
- Quality of life additions
- Visual feedback
